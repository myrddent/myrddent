Just wanted to see if anyone had any thoughts about a good starting point. For a little background. I was about 13 when the personal computer actually became a thing. ðŸ’» I have to say I was mesmerized and absolutely hooked, absolutely addicted. Not to mention the very first game that I had the pleasure of losing sleep over was; "Leisure Suite Larry & the Lounge Lizards!" I spent numerous hours in front of the keyboard in bliss. 
 Then of course I would go down to a local video store "Stone church video" They had a small section dedicated to the 5 1/4 inch floppy discs for a 1$. every week I would go down and buy 2-3 games. Rush home and start typing. C:/cd, c:/install.exe, ect,. and in those couple of years I became fairly good at C+. 
 That was until my mother's boyfriend decided to lock me out of the computer. According to him I had destroyed the PC from continuously installing, deleting, and installing new games to the point that he said I overflowed the hard drive. Basically he said I ruined it. hell it was only a 250 mb had, with only about 156 kb of ram. "Something to that effect." I can't remember exactly anymore. So my passion was stamped out after only 2 years into it, barely turning 16. I was crushed to say the least.ðŸ¤¯ðŸ˜±â˜ 
 Which brings me to here and now. I am 46, and I have a decent amount of experience working on, fixing, and upgrading computers. but I need a solid foundation in programming. I have been scared to learn it,  until now.
