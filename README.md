- 👋 Hi, Everyone! 😁 I am @Myrddent.
- 
- 🤓 I’m interested in learning how to create mobile apps, and how to develop software.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently interested in learning how to use a language, but I honestly don't know where to begin.
-  
- 🧑‍🎓 I’m looking for help with learning.📚 I would really enjoy learning from/with someone and perhaps creating a project together.📈

- 🙏 I would be very grateful for any help anyone would be willing to offer. 🚦😎👉 Especially if someone would be willing to offer me a possible direction to begin my journey.🧭🗺
- 
- 📬 I can be reached by email at myrddent@gmail.com, or on here. 🤷‍♂️ (That is I'm assuming we can correspond through github.)🙊🙉🙈
- 🤓Thanks for listening🙋‍♂️
